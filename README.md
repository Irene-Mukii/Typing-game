The general flow of the game will look like this:

* Player clicks on start button and is presented with a quote to type
* Player types the quote as quickly as they can in a textbox
* As each word is completed, the next one is highlighted
* If the player has a typo, the textbox is updated to red
When the player completes the quote, a success message is displayed with the elapsed time
